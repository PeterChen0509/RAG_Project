- Predict whether it will be sunny or not.
- Predict whether it will be sunny, cloudy or rainy.

 
The problem to be divided into two categories, such as "predict whether it will be sunny or not" is called binary classification, 
The problem of separating data into three or more types [predict whether it will be sunny, cloudy or rainy] is called **multiclass classification**.

An example of multiclass classification would be to divide data into several types, such as in the "{{% a_in "../../tutorial/crm_automate_voice_of_the_customer_labeling/" "Automated labeling of customer feedback"%}}" tutorial.
