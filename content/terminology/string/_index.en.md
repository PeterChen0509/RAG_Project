For example, the data type is set to [String Type] for a variable in which only some limited kinds of character strings appear, 
such as the variable for selecting the prefecture where the person currently lives in the questionnaire. 

Variables that contain text or strings longer than 40 to 50 characters have a data type of "Text Type" and are processed specifically for the Text data type.
