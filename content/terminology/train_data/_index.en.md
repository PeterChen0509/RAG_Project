**Prediction model creation (training) data** is the data required to create a prediction model in Prediction One.
Prediction model creation (training) data is sometimes called **predictive modeling data** or **training data**.

A part of the prediction model creation (training) data that is input is automatically divided into "evaluation data" and the performance of the prediction model is evaluated using the evaluation data.
The result of evaluation is reflected to contents such as "Model Summary", "Accuracy Details" and "Details of Contribution".

To specify evaluation data, see [Specify your own evaluation data]({{< ref "../../trouble/createmodel/use_own_evaldata/" >}}index.html).
