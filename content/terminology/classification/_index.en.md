**Classification** is a general term for the problem of determining for which group the given data is classified, for example, in order to divide garbage into combustible and non-combustible.

### Examples of problems that can be solved by classification

- Customer behavior such as conversion and withdrawal: By classifying records of customer behavior into multiple groups, we can analyze which factors determine customer behavior and predict how each customer will behave.
- Categorizing complaints and reports: We can automatically categorize large volumes of text to make manual processes easier.

### Classify using Prediction One

Referring to {{% a_in "../../tips/how_to_create_dataset/" ""How to Create a Dataset"" %}}, create a dataset that you can use for a classification problem.
Prediction One can handle two types of classification problems: {{% a_in "../binary_classification/" "binary classification" %}} to determine for which of two groups the given data is classified, and {{% a_in "../multiclass_classification/" "multiclass classification" %}} to determine for which of three or more groups the given data is classified.
