### Operating Environment

Prediction One for the cloud runs in a web browser. The system requirements are as follows:

- Google Chrome (Version 89 or later)
- Microsoft Edge (Version 89 or later)

### Differences between Cloud and Desktop

- The cloud version requires no installation and runs in a web browser. It is now available on macOS.
- In the cloud version, data and models can be shared by your teams. Teams of two or more can analyze efficiently. Suitable for use in organizations.
- In the cloud version, you can create multiple models (training) at the same time. You can create models with different settings and data in parallel at the same time, greatly increasing efficiency.

### Various Limits

Computation time, number of models, and data storage capacity are counted and available up to the limit. The upper limit is determined by the plan. The free trial version has a lower limit, but the paid version has a sufficient limit.

- Computation Time: Counts the computation time required to build the model. The computation time accumulates as you create the model. It is reset to zero when the month changes. In the free trial, the calculation time is counted without being reset even if the month changes.
- Number of models: The number of models created is the number of model stores.
- Data storage capacity: Data files can be uploaded. The total amount of uploaded files is counted. There is "personal" and "for sharing" data storage, and the data file capacity is counted separately.
