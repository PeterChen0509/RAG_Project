#### Situations and Challenges: Raise the cost-effectiveness of maintenance and operation through periodic inspections.

You belong to the department that conducts regular inspections of companies that provide and maintain certain equipment.
Based on the age of the supplied equipment, you conduct regular after-sales service inspections and replace parts. However, it is not possible to perform frequent inspections of all equipment in terms of labor and cost.
For this reason, you have narrowed down inspection destinations based on the period of operation of suppliers (conditions derived from experience), but the failure detection rate is lower than expected and the number of failures has not been effectively reduced.

#### Using Predictive Analytics: Improving Failure Detection Accuracy by Predicting Equipment Failures

- Prepare equipment status data (You will use sample datasets in the tutorial.)
- Prediction One is used to predict the probability that each piece of equipment will fail
- Create a list of equipment with a high probability of failure and conduct inspections preferentially

#### Expected Effect: Reduction of Equipment Failure Rate by Inspection

It is expected that the number of failures will be reduced because equipment that is more likely to break down can be inspected and handled in advance.

**Now, let's create an inspection list based on the prediction with Prediction One.**
