#### Improvement of defect detection accuracy with Prediction One

In the past, we used the experience and intuition of the person in charge to create a list of equipment to be inspected.
Prediction One makes it possible to inspect equipment that is more likely to fail by using equipment data to predict failure. The number of failures is also decreasing.

In the same way, it is possible to predict the failure of manufacturing equipment and wearing parts.
If you are unable to leverage the sensing data for your equipment, you can expect to leverage the data in this tutorial.

**That's all for the tutorial.**

**Use your data to create a customer list based on predictive analytics to drive high conversions!**
