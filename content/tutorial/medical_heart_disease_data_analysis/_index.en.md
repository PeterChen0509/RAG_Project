### Introduction ～Analysis of Heart Disease Data Based on Cohort Data～

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are showing new possibilities in all fields such as prediction and factorial analysis. In the medical field, it is expected to be used for analysis of disease data.

However, one of the challenges in the medical field is that there is neither enough time nor enough experts to analyze data using machine learning. Prediction One lets you perform advanced data analysis on your data with just a few clicks.

In this tutorial, we will take a look at the use of Prediction One by using cohort data to analyze heart disease data.

**Prediction One cannot be used for medical purposes such as diagnosis and treatment. Please be cautious.**

**Sample data used in the tutorial is fictitious data.**
