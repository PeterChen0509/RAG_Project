Include three pieces of information:

#### For more information about prediction model algorithms

Prediction One uses an ensemble model (prediction model by weighted averages of the predictions of the two models) of neural networks and gradient boosting decision tree to make predictions.

Each neural network and gradient boosting decision tree has its own settings (hyperparameter), but automatically adjusts settings (hyperparameter tuning) before being used in an ensemble model.

Both neural networks and gradient boosting decision tree are known to provide high prediction performance for tabular data, and the ensemble model improves prediction accuracy further, so Prediction One uses this technique.

Use it as a reference when you need to describe the prediction model details of Prediction One when you write a paper or document.
