#### Situations and Challenges: Analyzing Patient Data

You are trying to analyze cohort data collected in the past for heart disease. However, there is not enough time for time-consuming data analysis tasks. You are also not familiar with statistical software or programming.

#### Predictive Analytics Procedures

- Prepare cohort data (you will use sample datasets in the tutorial)
- Check how Prediction One predicts the morbidity of each subject in cohort data
- Visualization of contribution of each variable in the sample data from the Prediction One result
- Quantify the probability predicted by Prediction One against the subject data for verification

#### Expected Effect: Analyze data quickly

Prediction One makes it easy to evaluate the predictive results of the data used and to analyze the relationship between other variables and the affected variables.
You can also consider the possibility of using the analysis results in academic conferences and papers.

**Now let's analyze heart disease sample data with Prediction One!**
