#### Improving Operator Deployment Planning by Prediction One

Previously, you used to predict the number of incoming calls based on experience and intuition, but with Prediction One,
you can now automatically predict incoming number. Since it is mechanically estimated from the data, it can stably predict with high accuracy.
In the same way, you can predict the number of incoming calls by the content of incoming calls and the number of incoming calls by the time zone.

**That's all for the tutorial. Please predict the number of incoming calls with your data!**
