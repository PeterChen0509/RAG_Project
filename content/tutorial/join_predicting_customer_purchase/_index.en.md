### Introduction

The success of a marketing campaign depends largely on how you select your target customers to implement the strategy (DM delivery, phone calls, coupon distribution, etc.).

- For example, if you select sales customers by experience and intuition under simple conditions such as age, you are not fully utilizing the data because only a portion of the data is available.
- If customer information is stored in multiple pieces of data, you have to process the data yourself to gather the information

Predictive analytics can predict the probability (conversion rate) that each customer will use a product or service, based on customer data.

- There are many cases where the accuracy is better than when the person in charge predicts with experience and intuition while looking at the data
- If you input multiple data into Prediction One, you can use Prediction One for cumbersome data processing.

By targeting customers with a high probability of prediction for conversion, you can achieve higher conversion rates.
