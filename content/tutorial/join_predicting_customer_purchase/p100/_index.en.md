#### Improving Sales Efficiency with Prediction One

In the past, you used the experience and intuition of the person in charge to create a list of customers targeted for sales measures.
With Prediction One, you have created a more accurate customer list (expected to have a higher registration rate) by integrating your company's customer data, which had previously been separately managed, and by directly predicting the purpose of the measures (paid membership registration).

In the same way, you can predict other customer behaviors such as service withdrawal, DM response, and seminar participation.
Using Prediction One to predict customer behavior will enable us to take measures that are more suited to our customers.

**That's all for the tutorial.**

**Use your data to create a list of customers based on predictive analytics to create an efficient sales plan!**
