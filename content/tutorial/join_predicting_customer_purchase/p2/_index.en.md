#### Situations and Challenges: Priority sales to customers who are expected to register as a paid membership

You belong to the marketing department of a company that provides products for companies.
The marketing department regularly makes marketing actions to customers to sign up for paid membership. Recently, you have started to give priority to customers who are likely to register because there are so many customers that you cannot sell to everyone.

Currently, you are changing the content of advertisements according to the age of customers based on past data, but the registration rate is lower than expected and the effect is weak.

You thought that using each customer's company attributes and product page browsing history as additional information could increase the effectiveness of the advertisement.

#### Using Predictive Analytics: Improving sales efficiency with registration prediction

- Prepares paid membership registration data, customer attribute data, and page browsing history data (you will use sample datasets in the tutorial)
- Using Prediction One, predict the probability of each customer signing up for a paid membership
- Create a list of customers with a high registration probability and prepare marketing action geared toward them

#### Expected Effect: Increase Conversion Rate

It is expected that the registration rate will improve as you can establish sales plans centered on customers that are more likely to lead to registration.
