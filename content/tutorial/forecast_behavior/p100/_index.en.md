#### Improvement of vacation acquisition achievement with Prediction One

With Prediction One, you can predict the probability of achieving a vacation using company's employee data. This allows you to create a list of employees who might have difficulty taking a vacation and to support them through interviews. It would have been less effective to have a blind interview without making a prediction.

In the same way, you can predict other employee behaviors, such as use of internal services and participation in internal seminars.
Prediction One can be used to predict employee behavior so that employees can respond more appropriately.

**That's all for the tutorial.**

**Perform predictive analytics on your data and use it to solve HR issues!**
