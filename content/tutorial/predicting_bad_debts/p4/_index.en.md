In predictive analytics, a prediction model for predicting loan default is created by using the following prediction model creation (training) data that summarizes borrower data and loan default experience data as follows
: The prediction model learns from the prediction model creation (training) data whether these borrowers tend to default on a loan or not.
This tutorial uses sample datasets that were prepared.
