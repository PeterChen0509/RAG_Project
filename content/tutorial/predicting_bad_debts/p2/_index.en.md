#### Situations and Challenges: Pre-assessment mechanisms are outdated and not suited to the present situation

You belong to a section of a financial institution that reviews loans to companies.

#### Using Predictive Analytics: Improving pre-assessment using predictive analytics

- Prepare lender performance data (you will use sample datasets in the tutorial)
