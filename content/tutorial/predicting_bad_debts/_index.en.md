### Introduction

In financial services, one of the main decisions is to estimate the risk of loan default and accidents (Loan decisions, assessments, etc.). Improving the accuracy of this risk estimation will improve the customer experience and improve sales and profits. In some cases, the speed of risk estimation and the number of man-hours are also challenges.

With predictive analytics, you can apply state of the art machine learning (One of the AI technologies) to previously unhandled content and data at scale. As a result, risk estimation can be expected with higher accuracy and speed than before.
