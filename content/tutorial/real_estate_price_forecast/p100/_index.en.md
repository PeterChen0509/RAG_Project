#### Prediction One Improves Price Estimation

Prediction One can now automatically estimate closing prices based on data. Until now, you needed an expert to estimate the price. By automating price estimation, if the real estate data can be prepared, it will be possible to predict the price of a large number of properties that was previously impossible by a human alone.
Zillow is one of the first real estate portals to adopt this system, and has been able to attract customers to its website.

In this tutorial, we have used the price prediction of a house as an example, but it is possible to estimate the price in various areas in the same way, such as the closing price of a car, the price of procured parts, transaction prices, accommodation costs, and ticket prices. It may be useful to save on labor and for high precision.

**That's all for the tutorial.**

**Use your data to make price predictions and use them in your business!**
