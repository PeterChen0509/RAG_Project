#### Situation and Challenges: Prediction accuracy of store visits is poor

You are an employee of a restaurant and you are in charge of managing the purchase of ingredients. Every Sunday, you decide how many ingredients you buy for that week and place an order.
At that time, you place an order by predicting the number of customers, but if you miss the prediction greatly, the amount of food you throw away will increase. On the other hand, if you reduce the number of stocks too much, you may miss the opportunity to sell.
This is repeatedly hit and miss, and how to predict the number of customers visits is an issue.

#### Using Predictive Analytics: Data-Based prediction of store visits

- Prepare actual store visits data (You will use sample datasets in the tutorial.)
- Use Prediction One to predict next week's number of store visits
- Based on the predicted number of store visits, determine the number of ingredients purchased

#### Expected Results: Reduced food waste and increased sales opportunities

The accuracy of predicting the number of store visits will be improved, so you will be able to purchase more or fewer ingredients.
You'll be able to predict the number of store visits in a short time, which will reduce your work time and mental strain.

**Now let's actually predict the number of store visits with Prediction One!**
