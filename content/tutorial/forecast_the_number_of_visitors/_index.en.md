### Introduction

In the operation of businesses such as restaurants, it is necessary to purchase products and ingredients without excess or deficiency.

- If there are too many products and ingredients compared to the number of store visits, the amount of waste will increase.
- If there are too few products and ingredients compared to the number of store visits, you will miss the opportunity to sell.

Therefore, it is necessary to accurately estimate the number of store visits in the future, but there are cases where it is difficult to predict the number of store visits by relying on experience and intuition in the field, and it does not improve.
By using predictive analytics, it is possible to predict the number of store visits with high accuracy based on actual data of past store visits.

- The accuracy is often better than when the person in charge predicts with experience and intuition while looking at the data.
- If the person in charge of the prediction changes, the prediction accuracy may decrease until the newly appointed person in charge becomes accustomed to it, but predictive analytics is automatically calculated from the data, so there is no adjustment period
