#### Improving Product Development Efficiency with Prediction One

In the development of fragrances, it was necessary to find the amount of raw materials that had good characteristic values (intensity of fragrance). In addition to the large number of mixing patterns and the time required to measure the characteristic values, it took a considerable amount of time to find the optimum amount of mixing.
With Prediction One, it is possible to predict the characteristic values without actually measuring them, so it is possible to narrow down the amount of mixing that is thought to have good characteristic values.

Similar efforts can be made in the development of other materials, product development, software settings, and other cases where it is necessary to determine settings and parameters with good characteristic values.

**That's all for the tutorial.**

**Use predictive analytics in your data to improve development efficiency!**
