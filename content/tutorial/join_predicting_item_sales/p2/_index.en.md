#### Situation and Challenges: Improving the accuracy of the prediction of the number of products to be placed.

You are part of the sales department of a company.
The sales department manages the arrival of products and the number of stocks by sales channel.
You need to estimate the sales amount for each item and decide how much you will receive and place in order to keep the inventory by the sales channel for the items you receive regularly.

At present, you estimate the sales amount of each product by experience and intuition based on past sales data, but it is not clear whether the accuracy of the prediction is good or not.

You thought that you could improve the accuracy of the sales prediction by converting the attributes of each product and characteristics of the sales channel accumulated through experience into data and using it as additional information.

#### Using Predictive Analytics: Changing the number of arrived products by predicting sales

- Prepare sales performance data by sales channel and product, product attribute data, and sales channel data (You will use sample datasets in the tutorial.)
- Using Prediction One, predict sales amounts for each product by sales channel
- Based on the predicted sales amount, plan the amount of each product to be delivered and the number of products to be allocated.

#### Expected Effect: Improved profitability with accurate sales prediction

Improves the accuracy of sales prediction, reducing wasted inventory and reducing lost sales opportunities due to inventory shortages.
In addition, you expect to increase profits by implementing marketing measures for sales outlets that do not meet sales quotas.
