#### Situations and Challenges: Accuracy of failure type classification model is lower for the latest data

You belong to the quality control department of a company that makes PC peripherals.
You were successfully able to reduce work last time by following the tutorial for automating classification work.
However, you received feedback stating that the model you created is having trouble classifying the latest failure types.
Fortunately, you were sent the latest data, so you plan to use it to update the model.

#### Utilizing Predictive Analytics: Performing classification that reflects the latest data trends

- Follow the previous tutorial in {{% a_in "../../classification_of_fault_information/" "classification of failure information" %}}.
- Use the model update function of Prediction One to create a model supporting the latest data
- Use the model comparison function to check the improvement. Reducing man-hours with automation.

#### Expected effect: Achieving future automation reflecting the latest data trends

Even if the data trends change, you can perform prediction with the latest trends reflected.
Continuous automation of failure type classification can reduce man-hours.

**Now let's actually use Prediction One to classify failure types based on the latest data!**
