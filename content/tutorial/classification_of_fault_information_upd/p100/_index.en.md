#### Automate labeling tasks by Prediction One

The model update function of Prediction One now enables failure type prediction corresponding to the latest failure information.
We know this as a result of recreating the model using the latest data and performing an evaluation using the latest evaluation data.
In businesses where new data is accumulated, it is important to constantly confirm the prediction accuracy using the latest data,
and it is recommended that you periodically use the model update function, etc. to perform evaluation on models that are actually operating.

This enables continuous model maintenance in addition to the failure type classification that was previously achieved,
and reduces work by enabling more efficient automation.

**That's all for the tutorial.**

**Let's try with your data.**
