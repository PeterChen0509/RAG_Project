### Introduction: Churn Prediction

In the subscription (flat rate plan) services business, it is important to increase customer service continuation.

By applying predictive analytics to customer data, you can predict the probability of each customer withdrawal.

You will be able to know in advance which customers are likely to withdraw, so by taking measures such as dealing with complaints and concerns,
you can reduce your withdrawal.

If there are more than 1,000 customers, it is impossible for a human to estimate the possibility of withdrawal for each customer.
An analysis of the data might only give the analyzer an idea of general, rough trends, such as men in their 50s being more likely to withdraw.
Predictive analytics automatically considers all customer data and can accurately predict the probability of withdrawal for each customer.
