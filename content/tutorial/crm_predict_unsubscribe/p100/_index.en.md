#### Improvement of targeting with Prediction One

We used the experience and intuition of the person in charge to create a list of customers targeted for telephone marketing.

With Prediction One, you created a more accurate (expected to have a high withdrawal probability) customer list by using your own customer data to directly predict the objectives (withdrawal) of your measures.

In the same way, you can predict other customer behaviors, such as purchasing premium services, DM responses, and attending seminars. Using Prediction One to predict customer behavior will enable us to take measures that are more suited to our customers.

**That's all for the tutorial.**

**Use your customer data to predict withdrawal and apply it to your business.**
