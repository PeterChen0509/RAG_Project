#### Improvement of targeting with Prediction One

We used the experience and intuition of the person in charge to create a list of customers targeted for telephone marketing.
With Prediction One, we created a more accurate (expected to have high purchase rates) customer list by using our own customer data to directly predict the objectives (Purchase Premium Service).

In the same way, you can predict other customer behaviors such as service withdrawal, DM response, and seminar participation.
Using Prediction One to predict customer behavior will enable us to take measures that are more suited to our customers.

**That's all for the tutorial.**

**Use your data to create a customer list based on predictive analytics to drive high conversions!**
