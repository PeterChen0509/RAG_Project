#### Improving the accuracy of our shipping estimates with Prediction One

In the past, we used to estimate the number of shipments mainly by experience and intuition.
Prediction One enables us to calculate objective shipment prediction based on data. It is expected that the production plan will be more stable because the shipment prediction has been improved.
To this point, we had no way to make our shipment predictions more accurate. Predictive analytics tends to be more accurate as dataset items are added. This approach will enable us to steadily improve our prediction accuracy.

**That's all for the tutorial.**

**Let's predict the number of shipments with your data!**
