### Introduction ~Production plans by shipments prediction~

In the manufacture of products at a factory, you plan the number of shipments and plan parts procurement and line operation, accordingly.

- If you overestimate the number of shipments, the number of sales will be smaller than the number of shipments, resulting in inventory.
- If you underestimate the number of shipments, you will miss the opportunity to sell, so you need to estimate the number of shipments accurately.

Predictive analytics enables you to accurately predict shipments based on data.

- There are many cases where the accuracy is better than when the person in charge predicts with experience and intuition while looking at the data.
- If the person in charge is changed, the prediction accuracy may decrease until the person in charge becomes accustomed to it, but the predictive analytics is automatically calculated from the data, so there is no adjustment period.
