#### Situations and Challenges: Improve the accuracy of shipping estimates

You are in charge of production planning for a commercial display factory.
You estimate the number of shipments next month, and plan the number of parts ordered and production line operation.
Estimating the number of shipments is the key to production planning and has a significant impact on the core of business performance, such as the amount of inventory and the number of sales. Given the importance of that process, the constant need for accuracy improvement puts you under considerable pressure.
However, although you estimate the number of shipments by looking at past results, the number of shipments varies complicatedly depending on the inventory of parts and line conditions.
The factory also ships multiple products, each with a different number of shipments, and each product needs to be predicted. At present, the prediction is mainly based on experience and intuition, and it is not clear whether the accuracy of the prediction is good or not.

#### Using Predictive Analytics: Predicting the number of shipments based on data

- Prepare actual shipment data (you will use sample datasets in the tutorial)
- Use Prediction One to predict future monthly number of shipments
- Plan production based on predicted number of shipments

#### Expected Effects: Reducing inventory and securing stable sales opportunities

Improvements in the accuracy of shipment prediction have reduced inventory and reduced lost sales opportunities due to inventory shortages.
You feel that your mental burden has been reduced because you can make a production plan based on objective prediction values by predictive analytics.

**Now, let's predict the number of shipments with Prediction One!**
