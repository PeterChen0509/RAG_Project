#### Situations and Challenges: Improve efficiency of revisit sales

You work in the corporate sales department of a company that provides corporate accounting software.
The Corporate Sales Division is re-approaching customers that it has visited in the past but have yet to close. You are currently making a list of customers you should visit again, but the contract rate has not been good for the last six months. Also, this work takes time and it is hard.

#### Using predictive analytics: Create a revisit customer list by predicting the probability of closing

- Prepare customer data (you will use sample datasets in the tutorial)
- Use Prediction One to predict the probability of closing for each customer
- Revisit customers with a high probability of closing

#### Expected Effect: Increase sales closing rates and reduce effort to create customer lists

It is expected that the closing rate will improve because you can sell to customers who are more likely to close contracts.
This automates the creation of customer lists, resulting in reduced effort.

**Now let's create a customer list based on the prediction with Prediction One!**
