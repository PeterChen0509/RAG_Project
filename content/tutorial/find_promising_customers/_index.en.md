### Introduction～Targeting Promising Customers Through Closing Predictions～

Corporate sales and some individual sales (Insurance, real estate, cars, etc.) are conducted face-to-face, but face-to-face sales to customers are highly effective and costly. One of the keys to improving cost effectiveness is finding out how to serve the right customers. You can leverage customer data and predictive analytics here.

When you apply predictive analytics to customer data, you can use the data to derive customer trends and calculate the ease of closing for each customer (probability of closing). By conducting sales to customers with a high probability of closing contracts, you can visit customers who meet our needs more, and you can expect an improvement in the closing rate.
