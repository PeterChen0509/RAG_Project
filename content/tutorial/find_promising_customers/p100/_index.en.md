#### Automatically Generates a List of Revisit Customers by Prediction One

In the past, you used your experience and intuition to create a list of customers to revisit.
With Prediction One, we have created a more accurate (expected to have high closing rates) customer list by using our customer data to directly predict contracts. In addition, the time required to create a customer list was significantly reduced because the process took about 10 minutes.

Your company has products other than accounting software. By predicting the probability of closing the product, it is possible to utilize it in the sales activities of the product.

**That's all for the tutorial.**

**Use your data to create a list of customers based on predictive analytics to improve sales efficiency!**
