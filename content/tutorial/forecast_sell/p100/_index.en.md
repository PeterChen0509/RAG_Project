#### Improve the accuracy of sales volume estimates with Prediction One

In the past, we used to estimate the sales volume mainly by experience and intuition.
Prediction One enables us to calculate objective sales volume prediction based on data. It is expected that the manufacturing plan will be more stable because the sales volume prediction has been improved.
To this point, we had no way to make our sales volume predictions more accurate. Predictive analytics tends to be more accurate as data set items are added. This approach will enable us to steadily improve our prediction accuracy.

**That's all for the tutorial.**

**Let's predict the sales volume with your data!**
