### Introduction: Improve manufacturing planning through sales volume prediction

In the manufacturing of products at a company, being able to predict the future sales volume enables planning of parts ordered and products shipped to stores.

- If you overestimate the sales volume, the number manufactured will be smaller than the sales volume, resulting in inventory.
- Underestimating the sales volume will lead to lost sales opportunities.

That is why it is necessary to accurately estimate the sales volume.

Predictive analytics enables you to accurately predict sales volume based on data.

- There are many cases where the accuracy is better than when the person in charge predicts with experience and intuition while looking at the data
- If the person in charge is changed, the prediction accuracy may decrease until the person in charge becomes accustomed to it, but the predictive analytics is automatically calculated from the data, so there is no adjustment period.
