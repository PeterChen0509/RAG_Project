#### Situations and Challenges: Improve the accuracy of sales volume estimates

You are in charge of planning the sales and manufacturing of electrical appliances for consumer use.
You estimate the sales volume next month, and plan the number of parts ordered and products shipped to stores.
Estimating the sales volume is the key to sales planning and has a significant impact on the core of business performance, such as inventory risks and sales.
However, although you estimate the sales volume by looking at past results, the sales volume varies complicatedly depending on the supply of parts and economic conditions.
At present, the prediction is mainly based on experience and intuition, and it is not clear whether the accuracy of the prediction is good or not.

#### Using Predictive Analytics: Predicting the sales volume based on data

- Prepare actual sales volume data (you will use sample datasets in the tutorial)
- Use Prediction One to predict future monthly sales volumes
- Plan manufacturing based on sales volume predictions

#### Expected Effects: Reducing inventory and securing stable sales opportunities

Improvements in the accuracy of sales volume prediction have reduced inventory and reduced lost sales opportunities due to inventory shortages.
You feel that your mental burden has been reduced because you can make a manufacturing plan based on objective prediction values by predictive analytics.

**Now let's actually predict the sales volume with Prediction One!**
