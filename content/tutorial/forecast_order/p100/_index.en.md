#### Order prediction with Prediction One

Although we were using time series prediction mode in Prediction One, we still struggled to avoid shortages and overstocking completely. Taking advantage of upturn/downturn prediction, though, enabled us to not only predict order counts at various points in time but also determine how much we could raise or lower those values—findings that helped us develop manufacturing plans flexibly. As a result, we are now able to keep our inventory at better levels and cut back on both unnecessary expenditures and opportunity loss.

**That's all for the tutorial.**

**Let's predict the number of orders with your data!**
